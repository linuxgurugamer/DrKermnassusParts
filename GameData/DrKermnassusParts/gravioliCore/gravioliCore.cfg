	description = The Legacy of Dr. Weir Von Kerman, Dr. Wernher's more eccentric cousin, who passed long ago. Now it is in the possession of Dr. Wernher, who keeps it in a shed in his backyard. This large object is apparently the culmination of Weir's life long research into Positive Gravioli Particle, something that should not exist as predicted by the most current Gravioli Field Theories. It hums with energy from indeterminate source, and casts a warm green glow on the surroundings. Moving mechanisms could be seen through the spaces between the heavy shutters, but there is no obvious mechanisms to open it. Only a few hints of what it does and how it might be used could be discerned from Dr. Weir's scribbled notes. It is capable of manipulating Negative Gravioli Fields, making heavy objects behave as if less massive. Engineers claim it generates endless streams of electric charge. Some scientists say it also measures gravioli fields in the local environment though it is sometimes hard to make sense of the data that results. Rumor amongst the interns is that it can distort Time-Space, allowing a spacecraft to travel great distances almost instaneously.
