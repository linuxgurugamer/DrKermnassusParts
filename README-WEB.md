Made by user @nli2work, this is a lovely collection of random parts which look great, and some surprises as well.  @nli2work hasn't been around since August, 2019, so I've started my adoption process, part of which was trying to contact him.  So far, no reply.  Original thread here:  https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135033-113-dr-kermnassus-parts-emporium/

This adoption has the full knowledge, permission and approval from @nli2work, who also updated the license on all the parts to CC-BY instead of CC-BY-SA-NC-4.0, I've updated the license to follow.

A collection of random parts made for the fun of it. All will work with vanilla KSP. With the magic of ModuleManager some parts will behave differently depending on the mods you are running, or you may get extra parts that work only if certain mods are installed. There're no interdependencies... so you can remove the parts you don't want by deleting

Ikerus Mk1 (Left): Single part solar heat shield in 3.75m diameter housing, deploys to ~38 meters in diameter. Deploys once only. Generates small amount of EC through thermoelectric effect. Kerbal for scale.

Ikerus Mk2 (Mid/Right): multi-part solar heat shield for KAS/KIS assembly in orbit. Central hub is 5m diameter and is applicable for variety of situations that require high temperature tolerance so long as active cooling is available. Most effective against radiative heating. Total of 12 panel sections to be attached around the center hub piece, can be built to any size between ~11m (17 pieces total) to 100m (449 pieces total) in diameter in roughly 10m increments. Every 4th ring section have additional structures for strut attachments.

To Do

Add tags to those parts missing tags
Do a sanity check on the costs and tech tree locations
Validate the standard parameters, such as temp limits, etc.  From what I’ve seen, not much if any need to be changed
Create PatchManager configs, so you can easily add or remove whichever parts you want.  This will be optional, no dependency, although if you want to use it, you will also need ModuleManager
