description = So many rocket adaptors between various sizes and shapes, but no such for rovers... oh the injustice. But that's a thing of the past, with Dr. Kermnassus's Rectlinear Wonder Adaptor! Lowers your rover's COM; provides plenty of attachment surfaces and extra clearance for wheels; and helps you convert that unused rocket fuel to electric charge!
