Parts mod made by KSP Forum user @nli2work

This is a group of random parts @nli2work made for the fun of it. All will work with 
vanilla KSP. With the magic of ModuleManager some parts will behave differently 
depending on the mods you are running, or you may get extra parts that work only 
if certain mods are installed. There're no interdependencies... so you can remove
the parts you don't want by deleting the part's folder.
