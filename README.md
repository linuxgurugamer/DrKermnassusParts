Parts mod made by KSP Forum user @nli2work

This is a group of random parts @nli2work made for the fun of it. All will work with 
vanilla KSP. With the magic of ModuleManager some parts will behave differently 
depending on the mods you are running, or you may get extra parts that work only 
if certain mods are installed. There're no interdependencies... so you can remove
the parts you don't want by deleting the part's folder.

Ikerus Mk1: Single part solar heat shield in 3.75m diameter housing, deploys to 
~38 meters in diameter. Deploys once only. Generates small amount of EC through thermoelectric effect. Kerbal for scale.

Ikerus Mk2: multi-part solar heat shield for KAS/KIS assembly in orbit. Central hub
is 5m diameter and is applicable for variety of situations that require high
temperature tolerance so long as active cooling is available. Most effective
against radiative heating. Total of 12 panel sections to be attached around the
center hub piece, can be built to any size between ~11m (17 pieces total) to 100m
(449 pieces total) in diameter in roughly 10m increments. Every 4th ring section
have additional structures for strut attachments.
